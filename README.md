# Query-Strings-using-JavaScript
These HTML files demonstrates the usage of Query Strings in web pages using JavaScript

To make the above code working, make sure that you add some query strings for testing it out beforehand. For instance, once the HTML is loaded the URL will be somewhat like -
file:///C:/Users/sapaul/Desktop/QueryStrings.html
Add the query string for country with some value. The final URL will be somewhat like this â€“ 
file:///C:/Users/sapaul/Desktop/QueryStrings.html?country=Brazil
